# Brain-Tumor-Prediction-Kaggle
NOTE: notebook does not render in github, download it. In this project I aim to predict whether an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) image shows a brain tumor or not. The model this project focuses on is the Multi Layer Perceptron. It includes an investigation of the model itself to understand at some level, how the model works.
All explanations are included in the notebook and it is sectioned for better readability.
